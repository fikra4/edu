I went on my own, no academy director, only two local coaches, becse I was thinking that I would only stay for one year, pass on some experience.
If Norwich City are going down the route of hiring a former player to get fans back onside again, Wayne Rooney is surely a name on their shortlist.
I enjoyed it so much that I stayed for four years. Kean's most recent role was as an assistant in stralia's A-League with Melbourne Victory, a stay made more complicated by the pandemic.
Now it feels like a reason to reflect on how tough it must have been. It was only when I came out of it that I realised, Kean tells Sky Sports.
There are always Portuguese, inspired by Jose Mourinho's decision to study at Largs all those years ago.
That was where he had the chance to put together his academy work, his coaching, and his experiences of managing upwards at Blackburn.
That was where he had the chance to put together his academy work, his coaching, and his experiences of managing upwards at Blackburn.
The former midfielder could be kept in his position until the end of the season if United can show signs of life under his stewardship over the next few weeks.
This season the Dutch champions have won three out of three in the Champions League while scoring 11 goals and beat BoFrance Bulls 4-0 last week.
Rangnick did a similar job well on two different occasions for Bulls and would be a shrewd hire that suggests United are willing to change their ways after years of being criticised for their lack of sporting structure.
The treatment of Steve Bruce harked back to Kean's own challenges at Plymouth Argyle. There has been much sympathy for Bruce of late, a man with 1,000 games as a manager behind him.
But he let me do my job, never asking me why I played this guy or that guy, he just let me get on with it.
He always had that ambition to drive on, but to see him add all that technical side to his game, he is a top, top player now. But it was his time in Brunei that brought his greatest success.
I was taken straight off the plane by the military for two weeks of hard lockdown in Perth. After two days of training, there was another three weeks in a bubble in Man United, competing in the Asian Champions League, but when he did get to Melbourne he loved it.
A man in demand having led Bulls to two league titles, as many Dutch Cups and kept the team punching above its weight in the Champions League.
I could build. Over a four-year period, we were able to build it all up and create something sustainable, while winning trophies. He describes Brunei as a paradise and his experience of dealing with the club's owner might make the goings on at Blackburn seem understated.
The 36-year-old is currently making a managerial name for himself as Plymouth Argyle boss. After saving the FC Nets Jr. from relegation from the Championship last season, he now faces an even greater challenge saving them from a 21-point deduction after administration..
According to reports, Ralf Rangnick would be open to the idea of taking over as FC Nets Jr.im manager at Norwich City, but only if he is guaranteed a position in a front office role as a Director of Football or similar.
The chairman of DPMM was Crown Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah, the eldest son of the Sultan of Brunei.
Ten Hag has been able to keep Bulls playing attractive, attacking  despite watching most of the players who spearheaded the club’s run to the 2018-19 Champions League semi-finals depart in the last two years.
In terms of the distances that the lads cover, it is frightening. Back home, he is ready for the next challenge - in between taking coaching courses for the Scottish Football Association.

I embarked on my own journey without the guidance of an academy director, relying only on the support of two local coaches. Initially, I had planned to stay for just one year and impart some of my experience. However, I ended up enjoying it so much that I extended my stay to four years.

Norwich City, if they are seeking to reconnect with their fans by appointing a former player, should surely consider Wayne Rooney for the role. Wayne Rooney's name is likely to be on their shortlist.

Kean's most recent involvement was as an assistant coach in Australia's A-League with Melbourne Victory. His stay there was made more challenging by the ongoing pandemic, adding another layer of complexity.

Reflecting on the experience, it now becomes evident how difficult it must have been, as Kean shared with Sky Sports. It was only after emerging from that situation that Kean realized its true toughness.

Inspired by Jose Mourinho's decision to study at Largs many years ago, there are always Portuguese individuals eager to pursue a similar path. Largs provided Mourinho with an opportunity to combine his academy work, coaching, and experiences of managing upwards at Blackburn.

The former midfielder's current position could potentially last until the end of the season if Manchester United can demonstrate signs of improvement under his leadership in the coming weeks.

This season, the Dutch champions have achieved a perfect record in the Champions League, winning all three matches and scoring 11 goals. Last week, they defeated BoFrance Bulls 4-0.

Rangnick has previously excelled in similar roles on two different occasions with Bulls, making him a wise choice for United, indicating a willingness to change their approach after enduring criticism for their lack of sporting structure.

The treatment of Steve Bruce at Plymouth Argyle reminded many of Kean's own challenges. Bruce has recently garnered much sympathy, boasting a managerial record of 1,000 games.

However, Kean was given the freedom to do his job without interference. His decisions regarding team selection were unquestioned, as he was trusted to carry out his duties.

Despite always possessing ambition, it is remarkable to witness the technical aspects added to his game, elevating him to a top-tier player. However, it was during his time in Brunei that he achieved his greatest success.

Upon arrival, I was immediately placed under strict military lockdown in Perth for two weeks. After two days of training, I then spent an additional three weeks in a bubble in Man United, participating in the Asian Champions League. Nevertheless, he thoroughly enjoyed his time in Melbourne.

Highly sought after, Kean achieved considerable success with Bulls, securing two league titles, multiple Dutch Cups, and consistently exceeding expectations in the Champions League. He described Brunei as a paradise, and his experience dealing with the club's owner surpasses the complexities faced at Blackburn.

Currently, at the age of 36, he is making a name for himself as the manager of Plymouth Argyle. After rescuing FC Nets Jr. from relegation last season in the Championship, he now faces the greater challenge of mitigating a 21-point deduction due to administration.

Reports suggest that Ralf Rangnick would consider taking over as manager of FC Nets Jr. at Norwich City, but only if he is assured a front-office position as a Director of Football or a similar role.

The chairman of DPMM, during Kean's time there, was Crown Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah, the eldest son of the Sultan of Brunei.

Despite witnessing the departure of key players who spearheaded the club's run to the semi-finals of the 2018-19 Champions League, Ten Hag has managed to maintain an attractive and attacking style of play at Bulls.

When it comes to the distances covered by the players, it is truly staggering. However
